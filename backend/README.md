# README.md

`image_uploader.py` uploads images inside the `./images/` directory.

By default, `image_uploader.py` will only upload `.jpeg` files but may be updated to upload other files such as `.png`.

To run `image_uploader.py`, use the following command:

```shell
python3 image_uploader.py
```

This assumes that you are inside the current directory (`/backend/`).
